## Documentation

* See the Tango documentation [here](http://tango-controls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/administration/services/hdbpp/index.html#hdb-an-archiving-historian-service) for broader information about the HB++ archiving system and its integration into Tango Controls
* hdbpp-es [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/tango-controls-hdbpp/libhdbpp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) contains the latest changes both released and in development.

## Bugs Reports

Please file bug reports above in the issues section.

## Building and Installation

In its simplest form, clone the repository and assuming a standard install for all dependencies:

```
cd hdbpp-es
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
make install
```

### pkg-config Settings

The build system uses pkg-config to find some dependencies, for example Tango. If Tango is not installed to a standard location, set PKG_CONFIG_PATH, i.e.

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/non/standard/tango/install/location
...
cmake ../
...
```

The pkg-config path can also be set with the cmake argument CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH. This can be set on the command line at configuration time, i.e.:

```bash
...
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/non/standard/tango/install/location ../
...
```

### Build Dependencies

Build dependencies:

* libhdbpp version 2 or greater. Not compatible with any version below this.

The build requires the libhdbpp project headers for building. There is two methods to include this dependency:

* libhdbpp can be installed in either a standard or non-standard location and cmake flags used to locate it.
* Enabled the custom cmake flag FETCH_LIBHDBPP (see below) and cmake will download the project at configuration time and integrate it directly into the build. This is ideal for testing the project in isolation from a deployed system.

Ensure the development version of the dependencies are installed. These are as follows:

* Tango Controls 9 or higher development headers and libraries
* omniORB release 4 or higher development headers and libraries
* libzmq3-dev or libzmq5-dev

If they have not been installed to a standard location, then use the pkg-config settings above to inform the build where they are located.

### Toolchain Dependencies

If wishing to build the project, ensure the following dependencies are met:

* CMake 3.6 or higher
* C++11 compatible compiler (Tango dependency requires CX11)

### Project Flags

| Flag | Setting | Default | Description |
|------|-----|-----|-----|
| ENABLE_CLANG | ON/OFF | OFF | Clang code static analysis and cppcore guideline enforcement |
| FETCH_LIBHDBPP | ON/OFF | OFF | Download and build against libhdbpp locally |
| LIBHDBPP_BACKEND | "backend_name" | "timescaledb" | Backend to use for this build. Supported values are timescaledb, mysql, cassandra. |
| FETCH_LIBHDBPP_TAG | tag/branch | master | When FETCH_LIBHDBPP is enabled, this flag defines the tag/branch to download |

### Standard CMake Flags

The build system is CMake therefore standard CMake flags can be used to influence the build and installation process. The following is a list of common useful CMake flags and their use:

| Flag | Use |
|------|-----|
| CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX | Standard CMake flag to modify the install prefix. |
| CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH | Standard CMake flag to add include paths to the search path. |
| CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH | Standard CMake flag to add paths to the library search path |
